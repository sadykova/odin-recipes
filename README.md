# odin-recipes

In this project I am using basic HTML to create a website with 3 breakfast recipes. In this assignment I practiced writing HTML boilerplate. Added HTML elements such as paragraphs, two levels of heading, images and links (absolute and relative). I also used git version control system to record progress in my project. I used commands such as git add, got commit and git push to stage modified files and push them to GitHub repository.
